# DCC-Turnout-Decoder-Direct


Code is based on the NMRA Turnout Decoder pulsed 8 example.

Additions include:

-- programming parameters via serial port

-- programming address via learning mode



This is a combination of these repos:


https://github.com/Rosscoetrain/DCC-Turnout-Decoder-2


https://github.com/Rosscoetrain/DCC-Solenoid-Turnout-Driver


It provides control of up to 8 solenoid turnouts or other solenoid driven devices on model railroads.


The hardware that this can be used with is here:
